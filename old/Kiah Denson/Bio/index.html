    <h1 class="heading">About Kiah</h1>
    <div class="text"><br>
      Kiah Denson was born and raised in Austin, TX. She graduated from Colorado College in 2005, earning a BA in Studio Art with a Distinction in Art. Upon graduation, Kiah started her own decorative painting business. After a few years, she began creating fine art again, and has been steadily expanding and exploring her practice ever since.  She works with a number of designers, art consultants, galleries and individual collectors across the country, and her art has been featured in several online and print publications. <br>
      <br>
      Kiah lives in the outskirts of Austin, TX surrounded by green fields, trees and streams. She works primarily in her sunny home studio, and also maintains a space at Canopy where she meets with clients and displays her finished work. (by appointment) When she isn't creating art, she can likely be found wandering in nature or swimming with her furry four-legged sidekick, Kali. Please feel free to contact her with questions about available pieces or commissions.<br>

<h1 class="heading qaq">Why don't you list your prices online?</h1>

Now I do! Up until recently, I didn't sell much of my own work myself or have a significant inventory on hand, and it felt too complicated to keep everything updated properly. These things are all changing, so I've adjusted to be more transparent and helpful to potential clients. Pricing can be found in the captions of images on my available works page. (If you are curious about past pieces in my portfolio section, please reach out, as I'll have to dig for some of those!)

	  <h1 class="heading qaq">Do you do commissions?</h1>

Absolutely! I get inquiries about sold works often, which is a wonderful compliment. Though I cannot replicate pieces, I can recreate similar feelings, compositions, colors and styles into a personalized and unique artwork to fit your space. Pricing for commissions is typically 20% more than off-the-wall pieces of a comparable style &amp; size. Shoot me an email for more information or to get started!

	  <h1 class="heading qaq" >Do you ship?</h1>

Yes! I have mastered the art of safe transport of my work. (Unfortunately, not internationally or to Hawaii &amp; Alaska...yet) The cost varies quite a bit depending on the size and where it's headed. Range so far has been $25 for a small piece up to $250 for a big ol' baby, and I tack that on at the end once all the details are worked out. Of course, if you're local or visiting Austin, you can purchase and pick up work at my showroom at Canopy. (by appointment--I'm flexible!)

	  <h1 class="heading qaq" >I've never bought art before....How do I start the process? </h1>

If you see something you like, simply send me an email or give me a call. We can set up a meeting for you to see the piece in person, or I can send more photos. If you want to see it in your space before committing, we could arrange that, too. (Locals only) No matter the size, purchasing art is kind of a big deal--take your time deciding, and buy art you love!</div>
